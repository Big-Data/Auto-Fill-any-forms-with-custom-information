## Feedback, comments?

Any feedback, suggestions or comments are greatly appreciated.
Please send me an e-mail (you will find it at my homepage) since I cannot check the Feedback here often.


## Privacy

All the information stored in the AutoFill script will not be sent to anyone,
it is just stored in the computer you install it (as Firefox private variables).
BUT, if someone skilled accesses your computer, he/she can read the data,
so try not to use the same password you use at something serious...
Each computer stores its custom data.
